## ⚙️ Requirements

All code is written in **Python** and uses common libraries such as:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter` (for notebooks)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Or use `environment.yml` if using conda.

## 📝 Usage

Each subfolder contains:

- Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks
- Input datasets (or links to datasets)
- Result plots or output files
- A brief `README.md` or code comments describing the work

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Machine-Learning-and-Pattern-Recognition.git
cd Machine-Learning-and-Pattern-Recognition
```

Explore any folder and run the scripts or notebooks.
